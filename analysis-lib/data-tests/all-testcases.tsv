1/12/2018 16:22:25	Artist Errors Various Artists on Track Levels / vice versa	LG	The artist for a track can't be "Various Artists." VA can only be for an album.	"Various Artists" can't be used at the track level.	The string "Various Artists" is user-visible and must be used in a translation appropriate for the catalog.		The original spec says "vice versa" but that doesn't make sense. Ask T.O. / Shane.	Track Artist				
1/12/2018 16:28:09	Various Artists cannot be written as V.A. VA, Various, etc.	LG	Variant spellings of "Various Artists" are illegal. Compile a list of variant spellings to check for. This should include but not be limited to V.A., VA, and Various.	This artist name appears to be a variant of "Various Artists." Only the exact string "Various Artists" is acceptable.	The list of variant spellings needs to be translated, or this test can't be run at all in a localized context.		Variant spellings outside of the ones given by The Orchard will be guesses. Need to ask Shane for more, and verify that the ones we invent are good.	Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)				
1/12/2018 16:35:14	Artist Name formatting (cannot be Last, First) 	LG	A comma in the artist name (Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s) field) is an error. This applies to every place where an artist name can occur in a record.	An artist's name must be "First Last", not "Last, First,"	This error is language-dependent and possibly specific to English. We must verify that it makes sense in every supported language.			Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)				
1/12/2018 16:48:48	Artist Name formatting (cannot be Last, First) [Release Artist(s)-Featuring(s)]	LG	If Release Artist(s)-Featuring(s) contains a proper name, it must be in "First Last" format and not "Last, First" format. However, it is hard to imagine an automatable test for this, aside from checking for a comma, which is already covered in another test. Todo: discuss algorithms.	This field must be in "First Last" format, not "Last, First."	This way of reversing a name will vary with language.			***[ALL FIELDS CONTAINING AN ARTIST PROPER NAME]***				
1/12/2018 17:34:03	Artist name cannot include any additional info (Iike their instrument, etc) [Track Artist]	LG	No field with an artist proper name can contain any text besides the name. However it is hard to imagine a code-friendly method for determining this. EG "Johnny Guitar Watson" is a legal value.   This condition applies to the following fields:  Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s) Release Artist(s)-Featuring(s) Release Artist(s)-Featuring(s) Release Artist(s)-Composer(s) Release Artist(s)-Conductor(s) Track Artist Track Artist(s) - Featuring(s) Track Artist(s) - Remixer(s) Track Artist(s) - Ensemble(s) Track Artist(s) - Conductor(s)	An artist's proper name can't contain any text besides the name. 	If we are using a list of non-proper nouns to detect failures, it will need to be translated.		Guessing at the method. 	***[ALL FIELDS CONTAINING AN ARTIST PROPER NAME]***				
1/12/2018 17:52:28	Composer cannot be listed as primary artist (except in classical genres and soundtracks with one composer)	LG	If album artist is the same as (release_artists_composer or any track_artist_composer) and genre is not classical or soundtrack, it is an error. If album artist is the same as (release_artists_composer or any track_artist_composer) and there is more than one value for track_artist_composer, it is an error.	Composer cannot be listed as primary artist.			Doublecheck this logic with The Orchard folks, probably Shane.	Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)				
1/12/2018 18:34:46	"Compound Artist errors"	LG	See iTunes 2.8. Compound Artist.  BUT any artist field containing an & may be a compound artist. Other than that it's hard to see how to automatically determine an error here, since it goes to very broad semantics.	Each artist field must only contain one artist name.	The "and" or "&" is language-specific.			***[ALL FIELDS CONTAINING AN ARTIST NAME]***	2.8. Compound Artist.			
1/12/2018 18:49:01	Band members cannot be listed as primary artists	LG	If we had a listing of band members then we could search for them in primary artist fields. The two primary artist fields are "Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)" and "Track Artist". If we had a band ID that could be looked up in Discogs or Wikipedia we could look up the members, but by definition this data problem precludes that. Maybe we could look up the track titles in Discogs or Musicbrainz, then cross reference to the band ID.	A band member cannot be the primary artist. The band name must be the primary artist.	It's possible band member names are spelled differently in different languages.			Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)				
1/12/2018 19:03:05	Albums with vs. and meets - artists must be listed separately as primary	LG	If the artist name contains "vs." or "meets", it is an error. The artists must be listed separately. If album title contains "vs." or "meets" and album artist name is the same as album title, it's an error.  For artists using “Meets” or “vs.,” all artists involved must be listed at the track level and identified as Primary. The terms “Meets” and “vs.” must only appear in the album or track title. Example: album "Duke Ellington Meets Coleman Hawkins"	An album titled like 'Artist1 meets Artist2' must list the artists as separate primary artists, not a single compound artist.  	The text "vs" and "meets" must be translated, and the way that they are put together in a sentence must be translated.		I am guessing that the "vs" or "meets" exists in the album title and not in the artist name. 	Release Artist(s)-Primary Artist(s)	6.1. Use of “Meets” or “vs.”			
1/12/2018 19:08:27	Generic Artist Names	LG	Banned artist names: Yoga, Workout, Meditation, Baby, Christmas, Top Hits, Chorus, Orchestra, or Singer. If artist name contains "cast," Cast names must be specific to a given show or production (but this doesn't seem program-friendly).	Artist names must be specific rather than generic.	Text of banned strings must be translated for each language.		We need to work with The Orchard to gather more generic names.	***[All ARTIST FIELDS, WHETHER A PROPER NAME OR NOT]***	2.10. Generic Artist Names.			
1/12/2018 19:13:10	“Live” on Release but not Tracks / vice versa	LG	If "Live" occurs in any track title, it must occur in the album title. If "Live" occurs in the album title, it must occur in every album title.	Live has to be in both the album title and track titles.	The text "Live" needs to be translated. ”Ao Vivo” in Portuguese, and “En Vivo” or “En Directo” in Spanish		This will create a lot of false positives. Work with Shane/ The Orchard to verify it.	Release Name	3.16. Live Content.			
1/12/2018 19:22:09	Track/Album versions that aren’t allowed	LG	Track and album titles must not include:  Album Version  Original Version  Previously Unreleased  Reissue  Original Mix  iTunes LP Version  Clean Version  Explicit Version  Mastered for iTunes	Some types of versions can't be a part of a title.	The version strings need to be translated.			Release Name	3.13. Unnecessary Version Information.			
1/13/2018 9:05:49	Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed by parentheses or brackets	LG	"Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed in parentheses or brackets." + "4.7. Soundtrack Genre. For soundtracks, or ringtones from a soundtrack, use Soundtrack as the primary genre." = If genre is "soundtrack", the album title must contain a parenthesized or bracketed expression with the word "soundtrack" in it.	Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed in parentheses or brackets.	The words "soundtrack" and "score" need to be translated, and conventions around their use may differ.		I'm guessing there is no other way to know whether this is a score or a soundtrack than the genre. Maybe we should add a warning-only heuristic checking for flagging text like "original soundtrack", "original score" in the album title. See the 	Release Name	4.1. Album Version Information.			
1/13/2018 9:07:59	Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed by parentheses or brackets (test #2)	LG	If album title contains any of the following phrases, it must be within parenthesis or square brackets:  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Original Score Original Off-Broadway Cast Original Game Soundtrack Music from the Original TV Series	Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed in parentheses or brackets.	This text needs to be translated. Language conventions may differ.			Release Name	4.1. Album Version Information.			
1/13/2018 9:24:21	The abbreviation for Original Soundtrack (O.S.T.) should not be used as an album or song title version	LG	Per iTunes, "The abbreviation for Original Soundtrack (O.S.T.) should not be used as an album or song title version for scores, movies, TV, musicals, or video games." So: it is an error if '(O.S.T.)' or '(OST)' (or the same with square brackets) occurs in a album or track title.	The abbreviation for Original Soundtrack (O.S.T.) should be spelled out. 	This text will need to be translated for each language.		Guessing that the brackets are a necessary part. Notice that the text "O.S.T." without brackets is legal and common.	Release Name	4.2. O.S.T. Abbreviation.			
1/13/2018 9:35:33	Titles including release dates, album name, track number, additional info (producers, single, etc), search terms, artist info	LG	Need to develop heuristics for each of these.	Tiles must not include release dates, album name, track number, producers, whether the release is a single, search terms, or artist info.	Heuristics may contain localized strings and conventions.		As The Orchard / Shane for examples of each of these.	***[Track Name or Release Name]***				
1/13/2018 9:44:57	Title Version can’t be iTunes LP Version, Clean Version, Explicit Version, Mastered for iTunes	LG	Check for these strings in title:  iTunes LP Version, Clean Version, Explicit Version, Mastered for iTunes	You can't have "iTunes LP Version", "Clean Version", "Explicit Version", or "Mastered for iTunes" in a title.	These strings need to be translated.			***[Track Name or Release Name]***	3.13. Unnecessary Version Information.			
1/13/2018 9:53:07	Use of “Exclusive” or “Limited Edition” in title	LG	Titles must not contain “Exclusive” or “Limited Edition.” (This is a rule from iTunes. It will flag many false positives, but we should do it anyway).	"Exclusive" and "Limited Edition" may not be used in a title.	This text needs to be translated.			Release Name	3.11. Use of “Exclusive” or “Limited Edition.”			
1/13/2018 10:07:51	Correct language set at album level (language should match the language of the metadata, not the audio)	LG	"Meta language" field should match the language of user-visible text in metadata.	The "Meta Language" field should match with actual language in user-visible text.	Need language detection on every string.			Meta Language	1.5. Language.			
1/13/2018 10:14:49	Side-by-side translations	LG	Somehow need to detect multiple languages in a title, where the same text appears in two languages. This is very difficult to implement! Not technologically / economically feasible. But see the original iTunes text: Don’t use side-by-side translations in metadata. Use only one language in each entry or localization. An exception is Korean, where side-by-side translations are accepted for all metadata except artist names.	Don’t use side-by-side translations in metadata.	An exception is Korean, where side-by-side translations are accepted for all metadata except artist names.		Guessing there is no heuristic for this. Maybe there is such a thing.	***[All user-visible text]***	1.8. Side-by-Side Translations.			
1/13/2018 10:32:36	Advertising on musical content (ex. “Buy our T-Shirt at Our Online Store”)	LG	metadata shouldn’t contain references to competitors of iTunes, nor to any URLs, logos, or dates for future product releases. Search terms and keywords should not be included in title metadata.	No advertising in musical content.	Text flags would need to be translated.			***[All user-visible text]***	1.2. Advertising.			
1/13/2018 10:35:07	feat. and with must be properly formatted	LG	Formatting of "feat." and "with" in titles must be lower case, in English, not localized, and in parentheses or brackets, where appropriate. Do not use any other spelling (for example, “featuring,” “Featuring,” “Feat,” “w/,” and so on).	Formatting of "feat." and "with" in titles must be lower case, in English, not localized, and in parentheses or brackets, where appropriate. Do not use any other spelling (for example, “featuring,” “Featuring,” “Feat,” “w/,” and so on).	These must not be localized. Non-English languages must use the English text.			Track Name	5.3. Formatting of “with” and “feat.”			
1/13/2018 10:44:26	Proper remix formatting (such as “Title (feat.Artist) [Remix]”)	LG	If "remix" is in a title, it must be in parenthesis or brackets.	If "remix" is in a title, it must be in parenthesis or brackets.	The text "remix" may need to be localized. 			***[Track Name or Release Name]***	10.3. Remix Version Information.			
1/13/2018 10:47:41	Part and Volume should be abbreviated to Pt. and Vol.	LG	The words Part and Volume must be abbreviated with “Pt.” and “Vol.” Titles should be formatted as “Title, Vol. x” and “Title, Pt. x,” where x is a number.	The words Part and Volume must be abbreviated with “Pt.” and “Vol.” Titles should be formatted as “Title, Vol. x” and “Title, Pt. x,” where x is a number.	These words and grammar need to be translated.			***[Track Name or Release Name]***	11.2. Abbreviation of Part and Volume.			
1/13/2018 10:50:19	Nonstandard capitalization	LG	This only applies in English. We'll need a library to perform casing compatible with the iTunes guidelines. Here's the actual requirement from Apple: "English titles must be in title case format and follow the casing conventions as outlined in Appendix 2: Title Case. In addition, for English, words before and after a dash (-), slash (/), or colon (:) must be capitalized."	English titles must be in title case format and follow the casing conventions as outlined in Appendix 2: Title Case. In addition, for English, words before and after a dash (-), slash (/), or colon (:) must be capitalized.	This should should only be enabled in English.			***[Track Name or Release Name]***	11.3. English Title Casing.			
1/13/2018 11:01:07	Explicit Flagging (?)	LG	Terms like “(Explicit),” “(Explicit Version),” “(Dirty),” “(Dirty Version),” must not be used for album, ringtone, or track titles. If there is a track flagged as clean, there must be a corresponding explicit version. terms like “(Clean),” “(Clean Version),” “(Edited),” or “(Edited Version)” must not be used for album, ringtone, or track titles.	“(Explicit),” “(Explicit Version),” “(Dirty),” “(Dirty Version),” “(Clean),” “(Clean Version),” “(Edited),” or “(Edited Version)” must not be used for album, ringtone, or track titles.	These terms must be translated.			Explicit (No/Yes/Clean)	15.1. Explicit Content Flagging.			
1/13/2018 11:04:24	Genres that don’t exist in iTunes	LG	Given genres must be in the table provided by iTunes. see the iTunes Package Music Specification Addendum: Music, Music Video, and Ringtone Genre Codes	Genres must be in the iTunes Package Music Specification Addendum: Music, Music Video, and Ringtone Genre Codes.	You must only select genres from this list, regardless of what language your content may be in (for example, a French hip-hop track should be submitted as Hip Hop/Rap). Genre names are automatically translated for each iTunes Store or Apple Music territory.			Genre	12.1. Accuracy.			
1/13/2018 11:08:12	Generic Titles (Track 1, Track 2)	LG	These track titles are illegal: Track 1, Track [N], Instrumental	Do not use generic titles, such as "Track 1" or "Instrumental."	These terms need to be translated.			Track Name	3.7. Generic Titles.			
1/13/2018 11:21:09	Public domain	LG	It is not possible to test for this programmatically.	Public domain content may be rejected by Apple.	Determining public domain status varies by jurisdiction.		We have to discuss this with The Orchard: this is not implementable as code.	***[N/A]***	"Overview" 			
1/13/2018 11:23:39	Repeated submissions	LG	Look for the exact same track or album data appearing more than once. Also look for near-duplicates, per rule "Content may be hidden using the reason: Repeated Submissions if multiple copies of the same content and/or audio files are submitted with a slightly different title and/or artist."	Repeated submission			Guessing that this is what the Orchard means.	***[N/A]***	1.10. Repeated Submissions.			
1/13/2018 11:25:05	Clearly non-musical content	LG	TBD after discussion with The Orchard	Non-musical content			Need to discuss with The Orchard to understand their policy.	***[N/A]***				
1/13/2018 11:32:13	Nazi propaganda	LG	Error: Content must not depict Nazi symbolism as restricted by the Strafgesetzbuch section 86a. Warnings: Nazi-related keywords. Compile listings based on Wikipedia page, e.g. "Heil Hitler."	Nazi-related content	This law is specific to content for sale in Germany. Some keywords may need to be translated.			***[All user-visible text]***	1.13. Nazi Propaganda.			
1/13/2018 11:35:20	Deceptive or misleading content	LG	Do not use genres, popular song lyrics, or the original artist names as the album title, track title, or artist for karaoke.	Titles and artist names must not be deceptive or misleading.	Keyword spam can creep in in an endless number of translations.			***[Track Name or Release Name]***	9.5. Deceptive or Misleading.
