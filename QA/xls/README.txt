These two files were sent by Patrick last week (May4) and one is .xls and one is
.xlsx .

Cooking-Vinyl.xlsx FAILS in a big RED BOX when converted to .tsv and run.
BlueDoor.xls runs SUCCESS and gives results when converted to .tsv and run.

Run as-is as Excel files they both fail on both MAC and PC. Message return is:
Dataset failed
Is this input file actually a dataset?
